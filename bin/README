Hi,

This is my response to the Poker question provided
by the Limeade recruiter.

I have implemented an object called PokerHand that has a 
compareTo method (similar to how a priority queue in java works).

The summary for the Platform Intern role also mentions how 
you want someone who values unit testing, so I took the time
write a JUnit test file to test all my PokerHand class.
It took me a while to write the JUnit file, so I hope 
you take the time to look at it.

The program can be started by running MyClient.java

Thanks for allowing me to take this challenge. This was
an interesting problem and I hope my PokerHand implementation
and JUnit test file meet Limeade's standards.

I hope to hear back from you soon :)

Thanks,
Adharsh
